Let's create a console UI that will allow the user to first pick from a list of available criteria.
Then the program will iterate until the user wants to exit.
Through each iteration, ask for details of an application.
Evaluate the application and print the results.

The program should have this flow:

1. List all the available criteria to the user
2. Ask user to select from the list of criteria

3. Start a loop
4. Ask the user to create an application - this should not use any of the criteria. This should entirely focus on populating an Application instance with *all* of its properties.
5. Process the application with the criteria
6. Display the results

7. Ask the user if they want to process another application. If yes, repeat the body of the loop. If not, exit the loop and the program ends.


Let the build task run the test.
Let the build run task run the program interactively.
